Goal: Create a well-crafted posting JSON file that synthesizes and optimizes data from output_XXXX.json and config.json

Use these output_XXXX.json and config.json files.
Create a really good posting, taking all the best elements from the data and create a .json file:

rent = {reasonable price for landlord and tenant, such that the listing can gain good traction}
text = {ensure that you've read and acknowledged all the detail from the output_XXXX.json for best results. create a body text that incorporates all the best details from the listing such that the posting would perform well.}
